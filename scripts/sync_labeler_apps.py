"""Sync the generated ``app:<name>`` block in ``.github/labeler.yml`` from disk.

``actions/labeler`` has no templated label names, so every ``app:<name>`` rule
must be enumerated explicitly. Hand-maintaining 15 entries means a newly added
app silently gets no label, so this script regenerates the block from a
deterministic filesystem walk of ``app/sep/apps/*`` (mirroring
``scripts/sync_alembic_version_locations.py``).

An app slice is the full-stack vertical for one app: ``app/sep/apps/<name>/``,
``frontend/packages/apps/<name>/``, ``tests/app/sep/apps/<name>/``, and
``frontend/packages/e2e/tests/<name>*.spec.ts``. Only surfaces that exist on
disk are emitted. Name mismatches are resolved by an explicit alias map that is
asserted against disk, so a stale alias fails the ``--check`` mode instead of
silently emitting a dead glob.

Run without arguments to rewrite in place; run with ``--check`` to fail
without writing when the committed block has drifted.
