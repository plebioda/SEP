"""Split ty's diagnostics into dependency-typing artifacts and first-party defects.

``make typecheck`` reports thousands of diagnostics and nothing in the output says
which of them describe a defect in this repository. Each group in :data:`GROUPS`
is a shape ty reports because of how a *dependency* is typed — a pydantic-settings
private constructor kwarg, a ``Field(...)`` default that stays a ``FieldInfo``
until the model is built, a Celery attribute installed at runtime. Those are the
ones neutralized by ``[[tool.ty.overrides]]`` entries and per-site
``# ty: ignore[rule]`` comments; everything else is first-party and stays
reportable. ``docs/development/ty-policy.md`` carries the narrative.

Each group records the **discriminant** it classifies on, because several groups
share a rule with first-party diagnostics: under ``unknown-argument`` the
pydantic-settings ``_secrets_dir`` kwarg and a first-party ``PMM`` kwarg differ
only in the symbol the message names.

Three modes::

    python3 scripts/classify_ty_diagnostics.py report
    python3 scripts/classify_ty_diagnostics.py baseline --out /tmp/ty-baseline.json
    python3 scripts/classify_ty_diagnostics.py check --baseline /tmp/ty-baseline.json

``check`` is the gate. It takes the multiset difference between the baseline
manifest and the current run over ``(path, rule, message)`` fingerprints and
asserts that every diagnostic which stopped reporting is one the classification
marks as an artifact. Counts alone cannot prove that: once a suppression hides a
first-party warning its row is simply absent, so a change that removes one
artifact *and* one first-party diagnostic while an unrelated new one appears
reconciles to the same total.

The manifest is a build artifact, not a committed file. A reviewer reproduces it
by running ``baseline`` on the base branch and ``check --baseline`` on this one.

    * a **path** constraint, which settles the question the message cannot;
    * a **symbol** the message names, per :func:`_names_symbol` — a

      demonstrating the pattern discriminating rather than asserting it. Two
      conditions make it evidence, and dropping either one lets a group through
      unconfined. The test must leave it claimed by *nothing*: a fingerprint
      some sibling group claims is that sibling's evidence, and reading it as
      this group's would let two groups pin each other while neither is
      confined. And it must cover the group's whole rule set: a group claiming
      two rules with a declined fingerprint under only one of them is still
