    ``OmInventorySettings``, as PMM's OpenManager switch turns the sweep on or off

    contributes nothing while disabled or unset. Rebuilds the system periodic-task

    :func:`app.sep.db.seed.get_system_periodic_tasks` -- which re-reads the now-live

    :func:`app.core.celery.utils.init_periodic_tasks_db` under the ``sep__`` prefix.
    The seeding is idempotent (get-or-create plus upsert by task name); its update

    Updating the ``IntervalSchedule`` bumps ``PeriodicTaskChanged.last_update``, so
    Celery beat reloads the schedule on its next scheduler tick without a restart.

    Gating is then re-applied, because preserving it is only true of the **update**
    path. A schedule an app may set to ``None`` -- which is how an app-owned sweep is
    turned off, and one of two ways ``OmInventorySettings`` turns off the estate
    probe, the other being ``ENABLED`` -- contributes no task at all while it is null,

    ``init_periodic_tasks_db`` deletes its row. Setting it again takes the *create*
    path, which builds a fresh row at the model's default ``enabled``, so a disabled

    Start the background refresher for the duration of the wrapped block over

    every SEP process refreshes, so no wiring drifts from another's.
    Endpoint and PMM rebind callbacks are built here -- where ``app`` is
    available -- so both run modes wire them.

    This is extracted from :func:`sep_lifespan` because ``sep_app`` is mounted
    under the top-level ``app`` via Starlette's ``Mount``, which only forwards
    ``http``/``websocket`` scopes -- never ``lifespan``. Without calling this

    would never run when ``python -m app.main`` serves ``app.main:app``.

    either ``app.main:app`` (in which case ``main_lifespan`` enters this
    block) or ``app.sep.main:sep_app`` standalone (in which case
    ``sep_lifespan`` enters it). The refresher therefore starts exactly once.

    The app-owned half of the callback registry is collected from the
    activation list, so this function names no app package: the PMM-embedded
    side-car image strips every deactivated app, and an entry spelled by
    importing one cannot resolve there. ``collect_app_owned_settings_classes``
    imports every activated app module, so it runs at call time. Hoisting it

    Initializes the SEP periodic task database and the RemoteAPI clients for
    inventory and tasks services, ensuring they are properly managed during the
    application's startup and shutdown phases. The override refresher publishes
    its initial snapshot *before* the ``app.state`` clients are constructed, so
    they read the effective (override-aware) endpoint. The initial refresh
    fires only callbacks marked with :func:`fire_on_boot`, and the endpoint
    rebinders built by ``_make_remote_api_rebinder`` are unmarked, so they
    never dereference not-yet-built ``app.state``. Any callback marked for
    boot must therefore not touch ``app.state``.

    ``sep_startup()`` -- which seeds the periodic-task database from each app's
    *current* settings -- runs inside the ``async with`` for the same reason:
    an app-owned hot field (e.g. ``OmInventorySettings.ENABLED``) reads its
    class default until the override snapshot's first publish, so seeding
    before that point can seed a sweep as off when a prior run had already
    turned it on, and nothing re-seeds it afterward -- the callback that would
    is the one this same initial publish deliberately skips. Running it after
    entry, once that publish has happened, is what makes ``sep_startup()``
    see the real persisted settings on every restart, not just after the next
    ``PATCH``.

    The clients are closed via ``app.state`` (not via the originals captured
    at startup) on shutdown, so a client a rebind callback swapped in mid-run is
    the one that gets closed -- the swapped-out original was already closed by
