"""Dispatch probe payloads to executor hosts and collect their NDJSON back.

Rides the pre-seeded system ``run-python`` task rather than creating one per app:
``POST /execute/run-python`` with ``meta.target`` naming the executor host,
``meta.config`` carrying the payload's JSON config, and ``payload`` a ``file://``
URI. This is how the ``topology`` app dispatches its collector shards.

Results come back over **stdout**, streamed from the task-log chunk store the way
:meth:`~app.sep.sync.models.BaseTaskSyncer.wait_for_task_output` does it. That
channel has no total size cap, unlike the 16 KB ``.sep-run-result.json`` file.

One dispatch per executor host, carrying every service that host serves -- the
payload collects host-level facts once and reuses them across its targets, so
batching by host is both fewer Nomad jobs and less duplicated work.
