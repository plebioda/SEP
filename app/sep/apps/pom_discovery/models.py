"""Define the POM Discovery persistence model.

One table. A run carries its whole fact set as JSONB rather than a row per fact:
the consumer reads a run's facts all at once or not at all, the set is a few hundred
small records, and a fact table would need its own retention story on top of the
run's.

This module is loaded by Alembic through ``spec_from_file_location`` without running
the package ``__init__``, so it must not import sibling app modules.
