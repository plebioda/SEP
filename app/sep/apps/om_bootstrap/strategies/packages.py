"""Install Percona Server for MongoDB from Percona's official OS packages.

First (and, for now, only) implementation of
:class:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.strategy.InstallStrategy` -- Ubuntu and Rocky
Linux only, matching PMM-15347's phase-1 OS scope. ``DockerInstallStrategy`` and
``PodmanInstallStrategy`` are future siblings of this module, implementing the same
protocol.

Every per-host step here is package-manager-specific (``apt`` vs. ``dnf``), which
is exactly what the strategy boundary is for: :meth:`PackagesInstallStrategy.plan_steps`
returns the same step *names* regardless of OS, so the stepper never branches on
OS -- only :meth:`PackagesInstallStrategy.build_step` does, once, per step.

The mongod port is never a field anywhere in this module: every step (and
:meth:`build_run_step`'s member list) assumes the package's own unconfigured
default, 27017 -- ``mongod.conf`` here never sets ``net.port``. Making the port
configurable is future scope, alongside TLS and per-member voting
(PMM-15347/plan.md §3 Phase 4).
