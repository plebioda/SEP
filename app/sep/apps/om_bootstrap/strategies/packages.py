"""Install Percona Server for MongoDB from Percona's official OS packages.

First (and, for now, only) implementation of
:class:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.strategy.InstallStrategy` -- Ubuntu and Rocky
Linux only, matching PMM-15347's phase-1 OS scope. ``DockerInstallStrategy`` and
``PodmanInstallStrategy`` are future siblings of this module, implementing the same
protocol.

Every per-host step here is package-manager-specific (``apt`` vs. ``dnf``), which
is exactly what the strategy boundary is for: :meth:`PackagesInstallStrategy.plan_steps`
returns the same step *names* regardless of OS, so the stepper never branches on
OS -- only :meth:`PackagesInstallStrategy.build_step` does, once, per step.

Data path, log path, port and bind IP all come from :class:`BootstrapSpec`
(PMM-15347/plan.md §6 Phase A). Per-member election settings (priority, votes,
hidden, delayed) come from ``spec.member_configs`` (plan.md §6 Phase B); TLS is
still future scope (plan.md §6 Phase C).

        ``distribute_keyfile``, immediately before this step): MongoDB's localhost
        exception -- the unauthenticated window a fresh member normally uses to
        bootstrap its first user -- is unreliable once a replica set already has
        more than one member. Confirmed against a real multi-member run, not a
        theoretical concern: 40 consecutive, freshly-connected ``createUser``
        attempts all failed identically once the first one did, because the
        exception closes *permanently* for that mongod's whole lifetime the
        moment any privileged op on it fails once -- not just for the one
        connection that failed it. Retrying, waiting for a stable primary, or
        avoiding mongosh's own extra connections none of it helped; the only
        reliable fix is to never need the exception at all. So authorization
        stays off through ``rs_initiate``/``create_pmm_monitoring_user``, and
        :meth:`_enable_auth` -- a finalize step, dispatched only once that user
        already exists -- turns it on afterward, per host.

        Also creates ``spec.data_path``, owned by ``mongod``, rather than
        assuming the package's own post-install already did -- confirmed
        against a real failure that it does not: mongod exits immediately on
        first start with ``NonExistentPath: Data directory /var/lib/mongo not
        found``, and ``start_service`` (``systemctl enable --now``) reports
        success regardless, since ``Type=forking`` only waits for the initial
        fork, not for mongod's own startup logic to run. ``verify``, a step
        later, is what actually surfaces the failure -- by then the run has
        already reported ``start_service`` as done.

        Sets ``processManagement.fork``/``pidFilePath`` for the same reason:
        the packaged ``mongod.service`` is ``Type=forking``, so systemd waits for
        mongod itself to daemonize and write :data:`PID_FILE_PATH`. Without
        ``fork: true`` mongod runs in the foreground indefinitely -- confirmed
        against a real run where mongod started and stayed healthy, but systemd's
        default 90s ``TimeoutStartSec`` elapsed waiting for a fork that was never
        coming and killed it, so ``verify`` found nothing listening on 27017 a
        step later, again after ``start_service`` had already reported success.

        ``systemLog.path`` is required alongside ``fork: true`` -- mongod refuses
        to start at all otherwise (``BadValue: --fork has to be used with
        --logpath or --syslog``), confirmed against a real run once the
        fork-without-a-logpath combination above was fixed. The unit's own
        ``STDOUT``/``STDERR`` redirects in ``/etc/default/mongod`` do not stand
        in for this: those capture only the pre-fork parent, which prints
        nothing once mongod backgrounds itself.

        Also creates ``spec.log_path``'s directory, owned by ``mongod``, the
        same way and for the same reason as ``spec.data_path`` above -- a gap
        this one had until a real bootstrap run against a bare host (no
        pre-existing ``/var/log/mongo``, unlike the sandbox's own database
        topology images) confirmed it the same way: mongod's control process
        exits immediately (``Can't initialize rotatable log file :: caused by
        :: Failed to open <path>``) if the directory the configured log path
        names does not already exist, and ``start_service`` again reports
        success regardless, for the same ``Type=forking`` reason. The
        package's own post-install cannot be assumed to have created it: it
        defaults to a directory (``/var/log/mongo`` on both Ubuntu and Rocky)
        that only matches ``spec.log_path`` by coincidence, and the wizard's
