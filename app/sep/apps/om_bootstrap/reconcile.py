"""Reconcile dispatched steps against their Nomad dispatch's real status.

Deliberately narrow: this module only ever *translates* a ``TaskHistory``'s
status onto the :class:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.strategy.StepRecord` that
dispatched it -- it never decides to dispatch the *next* step, retry a failed
one, or roll a run back. Those are PMM's ``om`` service's job, driving the state
machine as the HA-leader-only stepper (PMM-15347/plan.md §4 item 9): it reads a
run's current state through the API and decides what happens next.
``om_bootstrap`` only ever answers "is this step still running", mechanically,
so PMM's driver has something true to read.

One exception, not a contradiction of the above: :func:`reconcile_run` also
flips a ``RUNNING`` run to :attr:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.models.BootstrapRunStatus.SUCCEEDED`
once every host and every run-level step has actually succeeded. That is not a
decision -- there is nothing left to decide once everything succeeded, only a
fact to record -- unlike :attr:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.models.BootstrapRunStatus.FAILED`
(retries exhausted) and :attr:`~app.sep.apps.om_bootstrap.models.BootstrapRunStatus.ROLLED_BACK`
(rollback finished), both real calls only the stepper makes, which reach
``run.status`` through ``api_routes.py``'s explicit ``:finish`` route instead.

``finished_at`` is stamped with the reconciliation's own clock, not read back
from ``TaskHistory``: this runs on a polling interval, not a push, so the two
times differ by at most that interval -- an acceptable approximation for a
receipt, not a claim of exact timing.

``detail`` on a non-``SUCCESS`` terminal status is currently just the
``TaskHistory`` status name -- it does not yet read the dispatch's stderr for a
real error message (the way ``om_inventory/dispatch.py``'s ``_read_stdout``
does for its own purpose). A worthwhile follow-up, not done here to keep this
module to exactly the one thing its docstring claims.
