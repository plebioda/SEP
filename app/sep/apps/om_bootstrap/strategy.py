"""Define the step/state domain model and the :class:`InstallStrategy` seam.

No persistence and no execution here on purpose (PMM-15347/plan.md §4 item 9): this
module is pure planning logic, unit-testable without a database or a Nomad
connection. Two things are deliberately kept out of it, for the state machine (not
yet built) to own instead:

- **Running anything.** :meth:`InstallStrategy.build_step` returns a
  :class:`StepAction` -- data describing what a step needs, not an executed result.
  Turning that into a real Nomad job (the ``sudo raw_exec`` pattern
  ``exec-python-artifact`` already proves, PMM-15347/plan.md §2.2) is the state
  machine's job, so a strategy never touches the network or a host.
- **Persisting progress.** :class:`StepRecord`/:class:`HostBootstrapState` are the
  *shape* progress takes, not a database row -- SQLModel persistence for them is a
  follow-up (PMM-15347/plan.md §4 item 9: ``om_bootstrap`` owns durable state).

The dynamic-progress requirement lives in :meth:`InstallStrategy.plan_steps`: it
returns the ordered step *names* a given spec will run, computed from the spec
rather than fixed on the class, so a run's actual step list (which can differ
between strategies, and within one strategy between specs -- e.g. a TLS-enabled
spec adding a certificate step) is known before the first step starts. That is what
lets the UI render a real, run-specific progress list rather than a fixed one four
strategies would each have to fit themselves into.
