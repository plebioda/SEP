"""Serve bootstrap runs: create one, dispatch its steps, read its progress.

PMM's ``om`` service is the only intended caller (PMM-15347/plan.md §4 item 9):
it drives the state machine -- deciding when to dispatch which step, when to
retry, when to give up and roll back -- as the HA-leader-only stepper, reading
this router to know what happened and calling it to make something happen
next. This router itself decides none of that; it only ever does exactly what
it is asked; see ``reconcile.py``'s own docstring for the same boundary stated
from the other side.

Auth is applied at the mount level: ``/api/apps`` carries the
``IsApiAuthenticated`` router guard, and unsafe methods additionally require
the rank :func:`app.api.deps.require_minimum_role` registers per route.
Triggering a run or a step is root execution on a database host -- Adamo's
decided gate (PMM-15347/questions.md Q6) is admin-only, so both mutating routes
register :attr:`~app.core.auth.models.UserRole.ADMIN` explicitly.
