"""add bootstrap_run.member_configs

Revision ID: 4d7a2e9c1b6f
Revises: 9b1f4a6e5c3d
Create Date: 2026-09-09 12:00:00.000000

Hand-written, matching this table's own prior migrations' note on why:
autogenerate proposes a wrong diff against it.

PMM-15347/plan.md §6 Phase B: per-member replica-set election settings
(priority/votes/hidden/delay), keyed by host. Every existing row predates this
column and named no per-host overrides, so `{}` -- MemberConfig's own defaults
for every host -- is the only correct backfill value.
