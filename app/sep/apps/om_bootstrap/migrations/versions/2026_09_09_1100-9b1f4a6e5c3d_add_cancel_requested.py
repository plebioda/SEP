"""add bootstrap_run.cancel_requested

Revision ID: 9b1f4a6e5c3d
Revises: 2773844e362d
Create Date: 2026-09-09 11:00:00.000000

Hand-written, matching this table's own prior migrations' note on why:
autogenerate proposes a wrong diff against it.

PMM-15347/plan.md §6 Phase B: an operator's abort request. Every existing row
predates this column and never had a cancellation requested, so `false` is the
only correct backfill value.
