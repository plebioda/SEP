"""Define the ``AppSchema`` for OpenManager Bootstrap.

The app ships no UI of its own -- its consumer is PMM's ``om`` service -- so this
is the minimum the registry needs plus a run list, which is what someone
diagnosing a bootstrap would want if a page is ever built for it. Placeholder
columns until the real run/state-machine model exists.
