"""Register OpenManager Inventory as a ``BaseApp``.

The first of the SEP apps that exist to do work on Nomad clients. This one only
reads -- it runs a payload on each database host and collects facts no metric
carries -- but it establishes the shape the rest will follow: a periodic sweep, a
run history, and an API a consumer polls rather than drives.

``sidebar=False`` and no ``react_route``: there is nothing to navigate to. The
consumer is PMM's OM service polling ``GET /hosts`` and ``GET /services``, and the run
history is for diagnosis through the API. Registering it as an app is still what earns
the Celery module inclusion, the app-drain ownership tag, and the switch on the Apps
page.

    A callable rather than a list literal because ``SCHEDULE`` may be ``None`` to

    commit to a fixed set at ``BaseApp(...)`` construction.

    That the ``None`` check lives *inside* the thunk is what makes ``SCHEDULE``
    genuinely hot in both directions: turning the sweep back on over ``PATCH /config``
    re-registers the task on the next registry rebuild, where a literal guarded by an
    import-time ``if`` would have decided once and stayed decided.

    The sweep is what keeps the estate current at all: no endpoint probes, so with no
    schedule a row only changes when someone posts to ``/runs``.
