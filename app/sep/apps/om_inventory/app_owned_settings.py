"""Declare the om_inventory app's own settings class.

Owning the class here rather than mounting it on ``SEPSettings`` is what keeps
``OmInventorySettings`` out of a deployment that never activates the app: the
registry collects only activated apps, so a SEP without OM has no such section
to be confused by.
