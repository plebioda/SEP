"""OM worker probe payload.

Runs on one executor host under the venv the ``run-python`` job template builds,
and collects, for every target named in the task config:

* its server process (pid, uptime, argv, config path) from ``ps``, matched to the
  target by **port** -- a host may run several mongods, and each target's facts have
  to be its own;
* the installed version of the binary *that* process runs;
* a handful of database commands, when ``probe_database`` is set.

Once per dispatch, for the host itself:

* its OS and kernel from ``/etc/os-release`` and ``uname``;
* whether it can reach Percona's repository;
* every server process running on it, and which of them PMM has no target for;
* the installed binary version, which is the whole install decision on a host that
  runs no database yet.

Prints **one JSON object per line to stdout** (NDJSON). That is the return channel:
the orchestrator streams the task log back and parses it line by line. It is used in
preference to the ``.sep-run-result.json`` file because that file is capped at 16 KB
and silently discarded above it, while the task-log chunk store has no total cap.

The config arrives as JSON in ``NOMAD_META_CONFIG``::

    {
      "targets": [{"service": "sc-cfg00", "host": "sc-cfg00", "port": 27019}, ...],
      "probe_database": true,
      "credentials_path": "/root/.mongodb_uri",   // absent = $HOME/.mongodb_uri
      "auth_source": "admin",
      "connect_timeout_ms": 5000
    }

Every target is attempted even when an earlier one fails: a per-target error becomes
an ``error`` field on that target's record. The process **exits 0 regardless**, so a
partial collection is still readable. A non-zero exit is reserved for "the payload
could not start at all", which is what the orchestrator reports as a dispatch
failure rather than a probe failure.

Beyond the standard library the only import is ``pymongo``, declared as the task's
pip requirements by the dispatcher. It is imported lazily so that a run with
``probe_database`` false works on a host without it.
