"""Serve the estate OM holds, and the sweeps that filled it.

Every read here follows from one constraint: **the caller must never wait for a Nomad
job.** PMM assembles its topology document on the request path in about a tenth of a
second; a probe sweep takes tens of seconds. So nothing on this router probes. It
serves rows, each carrying when it was last collected, and leaves the caller to
decide -- which it can, because the age travels with the data and the consumer merges
by precedence rather than by trust.

``GET /services`` is the contract with pmm-managed. It replaced ``GET /facts``, which
served the last sweep's output as a flat fact list: an estate that is *upserted*
answers "what is running on this service" even when the most recent sweep never
reached it, where the last sweep's output answered only "what did the last sweep
see".

Auth is applied at the mount level: ``/api/apps`` carries the ``IsApiAuthenticated``
router guard, and unsafe methods additionally require a bearer and the rank
:func:`app.api.deps.require_minimum_role` registers per route. An unregistered route
resolves to ``DEFAULT_MINIMUM_ROLE`` (admin), so every unsafe route here registers its
rank explicitly rather than inheriting one: the estate deletes and the configuration
writes are admin, and refreshing is **editor**, because a refresh runs a fixed payload
and is the button beside a row -- requiring admin would put the routine question behind
the rarest role. pmm-managed's service principal is admitted by identity at that gate,
so PMM reaches all of these with its deployment token whatever rank a human needs.
