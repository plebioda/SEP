"""create the om schema and its tables

Revision ID: a3f1c8d24b71
Revises:
Create Date: 2026-08-11 12:00:00.000000

The whole OM schema in one revision: ``om.om_host`` and ``om.om_service`` for what the
estate *is*, ``om.om_inventory_run`` for what one sweep *did*. Table names carry an
``om_`` prefix on top of the schema that already qualifies them, because the schema
alone does not: the real-MySQL and real-PostgreSQL test lanes translate every
declared schema token into the same per-worker schema, which collapsed bare
``service`` onto SEP inventory's own ``service`` (``schema=None``) the first time
this app's tables were exercised against a real, non-SQLite database -- see
``app/sep/apps/om_inventory/models.py``'s module comment for the full account.

Rewritten in place rather than extended by follow-up revisions - the host counters on
``om_inventory_run`` and the ``SKIPPED`` run status were each a revision of their own
while this branch was being written, and both are folded in here - because none of this
has shipped — there is no deployment whose data a move migration would preserve. The
cost is local: a machine that ran an earlier version of this revision has to drop
what it created and delete the ``a3f1c8d24b71`` row from ``alembic_version_sep`` by
hand, since the migration that would have moved it deliberately does not exist. Once
OM ships, this file freezes and changes become new revisions.

The schema is named symbolically throughout — ``schema="om_schema"``, translated by
the connection (``app/sep/migrations/env.py``) — with the single exception of
``CREATE SCHEMA``, which is raw DDL and therefore untranslated. That statement asks
:func:`app.sep.apps.shared.om.config.om_schema` for the real name and does nothing
when the bind has no schemas.

Alembic's comparison sees these tables at their translated schema —
``app/sep/migrations/env.py`` hands it a translated copy of the metadata — so an
in-sync ``alembic check`` is clean. ``--autogenerate`` renders the *resolved*
schema instead (``None`` on SQLite, the real name on PostgreSQL), so a generated
OM script still has to be edited to name ``OM_SCHEMA_SYMBOL`` before it is
committed.
