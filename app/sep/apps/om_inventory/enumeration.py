"""List the hosts in scope, from the two sources that already know about them.

Enumerating from *services* -- which is what the app did before this module -- can
only ever produce hosts that run a database, and the case worth catching is the one
where none does. So hosts come from SEP's inventory nodes, filled by ``PMMSyncer``
independently of services, crossed with the Nomad executor list.

Crossing the two gives four states:

===================  =========================  ==========================
Node                 Has executor               No executor
===================  =========================  ==========================
Has MongoDB service  normal: probeable          monitored, not actionable
No MongoDB service   **nothing installed yet**  monitored only
===================  =========================  ==========================

The bottom-left cell is the valuable one, not something to filter out: a reachable
host with no database is where a database can be installed. What *is* filtered out is
the bottom-right -- a node with neither a MongoDB service nor an executor is some
other machine PMM happens to monitor, and PMM's own server node is one of them.

Matching a node to its executor host reuses the order
:mod:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.mapping` uses per service -- name first, then
address -- at the host level, where it belongs: every service on a host resolves to
the same executor, so asking once per host is both cheaper and impossible to answer
inconsistently.
