"""Map MongoDB services to the executor host their probe must run on.

This is the question the worker exists to answer: given ``rsc-node02``, which host does
a script run on to reach that mongod?

The matching order mirrors
:meth:`~app.sep.sync.models.BaseTaskSyncer.get_task_target` -- node name first, then
node address -- against the executor list the Tasks API serves from
:meth:`~app.tasks.execution.executors.nomad.models.NomadExecutor.get_hosts`, which
already filters server-side to ready clients with a healthy ``raw_exec`` driver.

**What this module deliberately does not copy** is that method's fallback. With
``strict_executor_matching`` off, an unmatched node resolves to
``next(iter(available_hosts))`` -- an arbitrary unrelated host -- and the probe runs
there and reports facts about a mongod that is not on that box. Here an unmatched
service is :attr:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.models.NodeResolution.ORPHANED` and is not
probed at all.

That case is the norm, not an edge: an inventory row routinely outlives the executor
that served it.
