"""Run one probe sweep: inventory, executor mapping, dispatch, facts.

This is the half of discovery that cannot be done from PMM. Everything PMM can
derive for itself -- identity, versions, replica-set state, reachability, load -- it
reads from its own inventory and VictoriaMetrics. What is left needs a process on the
database host to answer: the command line a mongod was started with, the config file
it read, and above all the *installed* binary version as against the *running* server
the metrics report. Their divergence is the upgraded-but-not-restarted case, and no
metric anywhere carries it.

The dispatch machinery lives here: :mod:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.inventory`,
:mod:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.mapping`, :mod:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.dispatch`
and the :mod:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.payload` package. An upgrade app and a restart
app will want exactly the same four, so they will want a shared home; this is where they
live until there is a second caller to justify one.
