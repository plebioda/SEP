"""Define the OpenManager Inventory persistence models.

Three tables, and the split between them is the design:

``om.host`` and ``om.service``
    What the estate *is*, one row per entity, upserted. A host row exists whether or
    not any MongoDB was found on it, which is what makes "which pmm-clients have no
    database" answerable at all -- and it is not hypothetical: the sandbox carries
    hosts with a PMM client and nothing else beside arbiters running a mongod PMM has
    no service for, and PMM's inventory describes the two identically.

``om.inventory_run``
    What one sweep *did*. A receipt, not a copy of the estate: which entity was
    attempted, on which executor host, whether it answered, and any error. Keeping
    the collected attributes out of it is load-bearing -- with ``RUN_RETENTION``
    runs kept, putting them here stores the same facts that many times over, and
    creates a second source of truth for them.

Each entity carries a few real columns for identity and freshness plus one JSONB
document of everything probed, so changing what is collected is a payload change
rather than a migration. The cost is that fleet-wide questions become JSONB queries;
promoting a field to a column later is easy and the reverse is not.

This module is loaded by Alembic through ``spec_from_file_location`` without running
the package ``__init__``, so it must not import sibling app modules. That is also why
the schema below is a bare string rather than
``app.sep.apps.shared.om.config.OM_SCHEMA_SYMBOL``: the token has to be spelled here,
and ``sqlalchemy_celery_beat`` makes the same trade with ``celery_schema``.

# database files. The one place they *would* collide is the test suite, which creates

    models fails at import.

    The lifecycle these implement is four rules, each cheap now and expensive to
    discover later:

    * ``failing_since`` is set with ``COALESCE(failing_since, now())`` -- overwrite it
      on every failure and "since" quietly becomes "most recent failure", so the

      kept with its own ``collected_at``, because what a host was running when last
      seen is exactly what is wanted while it is unreachable;
    * only a run that actually attempted an entity touches its timestamps, so a
      single-host refresh does not mark everything it skipped as failed;
    * the upsert lists the columns it owns explicitly. Nothing here is user-writable

    nothing needs translating anywhere -- including the scoped refresh, which takes
    the ``node_id`` PMM already has.

    ``text``, not ``uuid``: PMM's ids are usually UUIDs but not always. The PMM
    server's own node is the literal string ``pmm-server`` in every deployment, and a
    ``uuid`` column would reject the one node every installation has.

    The consequence to accept openly is that if PMM re-registers a node under a new
    id, OM gets a second row and the old one stays -- there is no host retention, only
    ``DELETE /hosts/{node_id}`` removes it. The usual answer -- a OM-minted id plus a

    ``machine_id`` is inherited from the container image, so most of this sandbox

    merge unrelated hosts. Hence no surrogate key: it would only move the guess into a
