    Single-flight is judged **per host**, not globally: with a ten-minute schedule a
    global refusal would reject a one-host refresh exactly when someone wants one. A
    run with no scope covers everything, so it overlaps whatever is asked -- including
    another full refresh.

    Lives here rather than in the API handler because **both** paths need it. The
    handler is the obvious caller, but the scheduled sweep enters through Celery and
    never touches it: with the check in the handler alone, beat would start a sweep on
    top of one already dispatching, both would enqueue the same job for the same host,
    and the Tasks layer would refuse the duplicate with a 409 recorded against a host
    that is perfectly healthy.

    A run older than ``stale_after`` is reaped rather than honoured, because a crashed
    worker leaves a row nothing else advances and it would otherwise wedge the app
    permanently.

    **The check is not atomic**, and where ``exclude`` is given it does not need to be.
    Creating the row and claiming the work are two statements, so two callers can both
    pass this check and both insert a ``RUNNING`` row -- two overlapping ``POST /runs``,
    or beat entering ``run_probe`` beside one. Each worker then re-checks, finds the
    other, and *both* skip: the estate does not refresh at all, and both callers are
    already holding a ``202`` and a run id that will never sweep. Losing a race to
    nobody is worse than either outcome the race was about.

    So a run that is asking on its own behalf only yields to a run that
    :func:`_claimed_first` says was there first. The order is total and both sides
    compute it from the same rows, so exactly one of any pair proceeds without a lock.
