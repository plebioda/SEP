class DatabaseOptions(BaseModel):
    """Define configuration options for a database connection.

    The sizing defaults are deliberately tighter than SQLAlchemy's own. This
    class feeds one engine per service settings class — three in all — and a
    program builds every one its import graph reaches, so the count is per
    program rather than per deployment. Under ``python -m app.main
    --start-celery`` all three programs build all three, and the Celery worker
    replicates its set once per prefork child, so the worker's share scales with
    its concurrency rather than being a fixed count. At SQLAlchemy's ``5 + 10``
    those three programs alone reach 135 against a stock PostgreSQL
    ``max_connections`` of 100, and the server refuses new connections before a
    single prefork child starts. ``3 + 2`` caps every engine this class feeds at
    five concurrent connections, a third of what it allowed before, which is
    what bounds the per-child cost too. A deployment that needs more sets these
    fields, which is what they exist for; the PMM side-car sets them explicitly
    and records its own per-program budget in ``sidecar/settings.yaml``.

    :param ENGINE: The database engine to use (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
        Defaults to SQLite.
    :param USER: The username for the database connection.
    :param PASSWORD: The password for the database connection.
    :param HOST: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
    :param PORT: The port number on which the database is running.
    :param NAME: The name of the database.
    :param POOL_SIZE: Maximum number of persistent pool connections. Defaults to
        ``3``. Must be ``>= 1``; ``0`` requests an unbounded pool, a footgun
        under a shared connection cap.
    :param MAX_OVERFLOW: Connections allowed beyond ``POOL_SIZE``. Defaults to
        ``2``, capping each engine at five concurrent connections. ``0``
        disables overflow; ``-1`` (unlimited) is rejected.
    :param POOL_TIMEOUT: Seconds to wait for a free connection. Defaults to
        ``10.0``, so a saturated pool refuses the request rather than holding
        it. Must be ``> 0``.
    :param CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Seconds to wait for a TCP connect. Unset passes no
        ``connect_args``, leaving the driver's own default. Forwarded as
        ``timeout`` for asyncpg; omitted for SQLite, where that key means lock
        wait rather than connect. Must be ``> 0``.
    :param POOL_PRE_PING: Whether to test each pooled connection for liveness
        before handing it out. Defaults to ``True`` so a dead connection is
        discarded and replaced transparently. Unlike the sizing fields, this
        is a plain ``bool`` rather than ``bool | None`` because the point is
        to override SQLAlchemy's ``False`` default, not to fall back to it.
    :param SCHEMA_TRANSLATE_MAP: Symbolic schema tokens this bind should
        translate, keyed by the token a caller's tables declare (SQLAlchemy's
        ``schema_translate_map``; see ``settings.CELERY.beat_schema`` for the
        single-token precedent this generalises). Deployment-declared rather
        than assembled from any one caller's settings, so this class stays
        usable by every caller without importing them — a caller that shares
        this bind merges its own token in under its own key instead of
        replacing the map. Applied to the application engine
        (:func:`~app.core.db.utils.create_app_async_engine`), to the migration
        connection, and to the metadata Alembic compares
        (:func:`~app.core.db.utils.translate_metadata_schemas`). Cleared to
        the bind's default schema off PostgreSQL; see
        :meth:`clear_schema_translate_map_off_postgresql`.
