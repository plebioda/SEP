class NomadExecutor(BaseExecutor, BaseRemoteAPI):
    """Represent a Nomad task executor.

    :param wait_interval: The interval in seconds between status checks.
        Defaults to 5 seconds.
    :param endpoint: The base URL for the external API endpoint.
    :param verify_ssl: Whether to verify SSL certificates. Defaults to True.
    :param ssl_cafile: Path to the SSL certificate authority file. Defaults to None.
    :param ssl_keyfile: Path to the SSL key file. Defaults to None.
    :param ssl_certfile: Path to the SSL certificate file. Defaults to None.
    :param logger_name: Name to use for the logger. Defaults to ``__name__``.
    :param secure: Whether to use a secure connection. Defaults to False.
    :param timeout: The timeout in seconds for requests to the Nomad API.
        Defaults to 10 seconds.
    :param minify_payload: Whether to minify payloads before dispatching Parameterized
        Jobs. Defaults to True.
    :param log_socket_read_timeout: Socket read timeout in seconds for log streaming.
        Defaults to 10.
    :param cert_expiry_warn_days: Number of days before ``not_valid_after`` when
        Nomad TLS cert expiry alerts should fire. Used by the periodic
        ``check_nomad_cert_expiry`` task. Defaults to 7.
    :param check_cert_expiry_interval: Beat schedule for ``check_nomad_cert_expiry``
        (e.g. once per day). Set to ``None`` to skip registering the periodic task
        in ``app.tasks.db.seed`` (Celery beat will not run the check).
    :param api_key: Credential sent as ``Authorization: <auth_scheme> <api_key>``
        on both the synchronous and the asynchronous request path. It takes
        precedence over any userinfo embedded in ``endpoint``, which is stripped
        for as long as a key is configured. An empty value counts as unset,
        leaving whatever ``endpoint`` carries. A control character is rejected
        here rather than at send time. Defaults to ``None``.
    :param auth_scheme: Scheme the ``Authorization`` header announces ahead of
        ``api_key``. Defaults to ``"Bearer"``.
    :param terminal_log_drain_max_attempts: Number of bounded re-fetch attempts
        after terminal detection to drain any stdout/stderr tail Nomad's
        ``logmon`` flushes shortly after the task finishes. Each attempt waits
        ``terminal_log_drain_interval`` seconds, then re-reads from the persisted
        offsets. Each finishing task adds up to
        ``terminal_log_drain_max_attempts * terminal_log_drain_interval`` seconds
        to its terminal sync, run inline within the Celery beat cycle, so lower
        this for large fleets where many tasks finish in the same beat and the
        added latency would otherwise approach the beat cadence. Set to ``0`` to
        disable the drain (behaviour identical to the pre-drain terminal sync).
        Defaults to 5.
    :param terminal_log_drain_interval: Seconds to wait before each post-terminal
        drain re-fetch, giving ``logmon`` time to flush the tail. Defaults to 0.5.
    :param log_anonymization_max_withheld_bytes: Maximum raw byte length that
        task-log anonymization may withhold while awaiting a line terminator.
        When the trailing partial exceeds this ceiling it is flushed anyway,
        accepting a single redaction-boundary leak so an un-terminated line
        cannot stall log persistence, stall the live viewer, or drive
        quadratic Nomad re-fetching. Setting the ceiling very low effectively
        disables line-boundary anonymization, letting a PII token that straddles
        two fetched chunks escape redaction, so the value must stay positive.
        Defaults to 1 MiB, generous enough that ordinary line-oriented output
        never trips it.
    :param log_capture_hold_seconds: How long the ``log-capture-hold`` step
        keeps a finished allocation alive so Nomad cannot garbage-collect logs
        SEP has not read yet. Injected as dispatch meta and enforced on the
        execution host, so it bounds allocation residency even when the tasks
        service never returns; SEP releases the hold early on the normal path.
        Must outlast at least two sync cadences, or a sub-cadence step's output
        is collected before any sync samples it. Defaults to 90 seconds.

        the Nomad log file and is used as the ``offset=`` kwarg for the next
        ``stream_logs.stream`` call; the producer offset tracks the byte
        position in the post-anonymization stream that the writer actually
        persists. Keeping them separate prevents the dedup window in
        :meth:`TaskHistoryLogWriter.append` from mixing raw and anonymized
        byte counts on retry.

        Anonymization runs on complete lines only: a PII token split across two
        Nomad frames (or across two sync cycles) is never seen whole by
        Presidio and would escape redaction. The trailing partial line is
        therefore withheld from anonymization -- the returned Nomad offset is
        rolled back by its raw byte length so it is simply re-fetched next cycle
        and joined with the new bytes. That re-fetch is idempotent because the
        withheld bytes were never emitted, so ``producer_offset`` never advanced
        past them; the writer's dedup covers a different case -- a retry after a
        concurrent state update. When the withheld remainder would exceed
        ``log_anonymization_max_withheld_bytes``, the buffer is flushed instead
        (empty remainder, no rollback) so the cursor advances and the next cycle
        does not re-fetch the same tail. ``flush_partial`` disables the
        withholding so a terminal drain can emit a newline-less final line

        A failed fetch is reported rather than raised. Letting it propagate
        would abort the whole sync cycle for every step in the allocation, not

        whole-cycle one. The caller records the stream's capture as incomplete

        Two detection paths, tried in order. The first keys on per-step task

        reaches its final status without waiting out the hold window. The second
        is the pre-hold behaviour, retained unchanged both for allocations from
        jobs registered before the hold step existed and as the fallback for any
        case where Nomad skips a step rather than marking it ``dead``.

        A prestart sentinel abort overrides the derived status on either path:
        both aborts leave a *failed* prestart step behind and a failed
        allocation, either of which would otherwise be reported as an ordinary
        payload failure. Where both fired, staleness wins — see
        :func:`_sentinel_status`. Each sentinel is read off its own step's task
        state, so the resolved status does not depend on the order Nomad ran the
        two prestart tasks in.

        An operator stop overrides a success but never a failure, matching
        :meth:`get_task_history_status_from_alloc_status`, where ``stopped``
        guards only the ``COMPLETE`` arm: a payload that already failed is
        reported ``FAILED`` even when a stop lands in the same window, so the
        failure is not relabelled as an operator action.

        When the allocation still has no task states and a non-terminal client
        status, :meth:`_should_escalate_pending_allocation` may escalate the
        row to LOST once ``PENDING_ALLOCATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` has elapsed
        since ``started_at``. The job is deregistered first so Nomad cannot
        still place the allocation after the duplicate-dispatch guard drops; a
        Nomad error is swallowed so a hiccup cannot leave the row RUNNING. The
        finish time is ``utc_now()`` rather than the allocation's
        ``ModifyTime``, which may predate the timeout on a never-placed

        :meth:`_persist_nomad_task_logs` can miss a tail ``logmon`` had not yet
        written, most visibly the burst of output right before process exit.
        This bounded loop gives ``logmon`` a short interval to catch up, then

        overlapping read cannot double-write.

        Advancement is tracked per stream, not per task: the loop early-exits
        only once every candidate stream has itself advanced-then-quieted. A

        only one stream polls the full window (correctness over latency; the
        window is ``hot``-tunable).

        Anonymization withholds each stream's trailing partial line until a
