"""Re-export the shared SEP test fixtures for the ``tests/app/sep`` subtree.

These fixtures are defined in the always-loaded ancestor ``tests/app/conftest.py`` so they
resolve regardless of single-process pytest collection order. They are re-exported
here so app-subtree conftests can keep importing them from ``tests.app.sep.conftest``.

The snippet-seeding fixtures below are defined here rather than in a leaf conftest
because the snippets engine is library-owned (``app/sep/snippets/``) while its HTTP
surface stays in the app package, so ``tests/app/sep/snippets/`` and
``tests/app/sep/apps/snippets/`` both consume them and this is their nearest common
ancestor.

This module also holds shared SEP-subtree test constants. ``REDUCED_ACTIVATION``
mirrors the side-car embedded activation profile
(``sidecar/settings.yaml``), which several modules across the subtree
assert against; defining it once here keeps those copies from drifting away from
the profile as apps are activated or dropped.
