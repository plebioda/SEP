"""Test the per-service records a sweep writes alongside its facts.

The counters answer "5 of 14 answered"; these records answer "which five, on which
host, and why did that one take a minute". They are the only place a sweep says where
it probed, so what they claim has to survive the cases that make them interesting: a
service with no executor, a host whose probe failed, and a service PMM does not know.
