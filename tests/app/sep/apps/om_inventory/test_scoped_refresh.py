"""Test refreshing named hosts rather than the whole estate.

A full sweep dispatches a Nomad job to every executor host and takes a minute and a
half in this sandbox. "I just did something to this host, is it healthy now" should
not cost that, and it is the question every action PMM grows will ask next.

Two rules make it work, and both are easy to get subtly wrong:

**Conflict is per host.** The old guard refused any run while any other was in
flight. Keep that and a scoped refresh is useless exactly when the estate is busiest,
because the ten-minute schedule is often mid-sweep. Two runs collide only when they
would touch the same host -- and a full refresh touches all of them.

**Nothing outside the scope is written.** This is where §5.4's "only a run that
attempted an entity touches its timestamps" stops being a principle and starts being
load-bearing: get it wrong and refreshing one host marks the rest of the estate
failed, which is worse than not having the feature.
