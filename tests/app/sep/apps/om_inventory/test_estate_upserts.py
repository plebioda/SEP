"""Test the freshness and failure lifecycle of ``om.host`` and ``om.service``.

Every rule here is one that reads as an implementation detail and is not. Each is
cheap to get right now and expensive to discover later, because the symptom is never
a crash -- it is a column that quietly stops meaning what it says:

* overwrite ``failing_since`` on every failure and "failing for three days" silently
  becomes "failed a minute ago", so the duration is always one schedule interval;
* erase ``observed`` on a failed probe and you lose what the host was running exactly
  when you most want to know, which is while it is unreachable;
* touch the timestamps of an entity a run did not target and one scoped refresh marks
  the rest of the estate failed;
* upsert every column blindly and the first user-writable field ever added is wiped by
  the next sweep.

The last one has nothing to protect yet, which is exactly why the test is written now:
it is the one that cannot be added after the fact, because by then the data is gone.
