"""Smoke-test the API-first surface of the OpenManager Inventory app.

A ``BaseApp`` exposes a declared ``api_router`` rather than the derived task
contract, so this mounts that router behind the production auth guard and asserts it
answers. Deliberately only ``GET /schema``, which needs no database: what the estate
routes serve is tested against a real session in test_estate_api.py.
