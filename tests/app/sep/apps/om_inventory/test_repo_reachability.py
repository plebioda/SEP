"""Test whether a host can reach Percona's repository, and why not when it cannot.

This is an install and upgrade precondition, so the failures worth catching are the
ones that pass a cheaper check. A ping succeeds through a proxy that blocks this
origin; a TCP connect succeeds against a TLS interception appliance whose certificate
the host does not trust; a status-code check succeeds against a captive portal
answering 200 with its own HTML. Each of those fails ``yum install`` and each has a
test here, because "reachable" meaning three different things is how this feature
would quietly stop being worth anything.

The proxy in effect is asserted too. Without it the result is unexplainable: a
refused connection from a host with no proxy and from a host behind a broken one are
the same string and completely different jobs.
