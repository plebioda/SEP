"""Test that each service's process facts are *its own*.

The payload used to collect one ``ps`` line per dispatch and copy it into every
target record. On a host running one mongod that is correct and cheap; on a host
running several it gave every service the same argv, the same config path, the same
uptime and the same installed version, while the database facts beside them came from
each service's own port. So the one comparison this payload exists to make -- the
*installed* binary against the *running* server -- was wrong for every service on the
host but one, and silently: the record looked complete.

A mongos beside a mongod is the sharpest version. The shared line reported
``program: mongod`` and a mongod version for the router, which is not a version skew
but a category error.

Multiple server processes per host are ordinary in the estates OM is for: an arbiter
costs nothing to colocate, and a router usually sits on a member. These tests pin the
attribution rule -- by port, with the single-process host exempt because a mongod on
the default 27017 has no port on its command line to match.
