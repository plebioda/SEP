"""Test that an abandoned probe dispatch is not left in the queue.

The tasks API refuses a queue item identical to one already in flight, and every
sweep dispatches the same ``run-python`` to the same host with the same config. So a
run this app gives up waiting for does not merely cost one probe: it makes that host
answer ``409`` on every later sweep until someone clears the row by hand. These tests
pin the release, and pin the two ways it must not misfire -- releasing a run that
already finished, and failing a sweep because its own cleanup failed.
