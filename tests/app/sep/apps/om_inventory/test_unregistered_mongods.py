"""Test the payload's report of mongods PMM has no service for.

Arbiters are why this is ordinary rather than exotic. An arbiter holds no data and
therefore no user documents, so SCRAM cannot authenticate and ``pmm-admin add
mongodb`` fails for it -- meaning **any** estate with arbiters and authentication
enabled has databases PMM does not know about. Three of this sandbox's nodes are in
exactly that state.

They are reported on the *host* rather than as service rows: there is no service id
to key a row on, and inventing an identity would commit to a shape before anything
needs it. What matters is that they are not silently dropped, because then the estate
view gets to call a host empty while a mongod runs on it.

The port is the join. Getting it wrong in either direction is a real failure: miss a
port and a registered service is reported as a stranger; invent one and a genuine
stranger disappears.
