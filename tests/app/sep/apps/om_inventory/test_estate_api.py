"""Test the estate the API serves: hosts, their services, and forgetting a row.

Two contracts here are load-bearing and neither is obvious from the handler code.

``GET /hosts?has_service=false`` is the question the host table exists to answer --
which machines carry a PMM client and no database -- so it is asserted rather than
assumed, and asserted as a *filter* on the ordinary list rather than a second
endpoint.

``DELETE`` exists because stale rows are real: restarting a node's pmm-agent runs
``setup --force``, which replaces the node in PMM and mints a new id, so OM gains a
row and keeps the old one. It is emphatically not suppression -- an entity PMM still
knows about returns on the next sweep -- and the tests say so, because a reader who
mistakes it for suppression will use it that way exactly once.
