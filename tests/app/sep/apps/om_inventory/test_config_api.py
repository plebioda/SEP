"""Test the app's own ``/config``, and the two decisions that put it there.

The app serves its configuration rather than pointing callers at
``/api/sep/admin/settings`` because that router is admin-gated and **PMM's principal
is not an admin**: ``--sep-token`` resolves to the synthetic ``sep-service`` user,
built with ``is_admin=False`` on purpose since it is a deployment-level shared secret
with nobody behind it. That is asserted here rather than described, because it is the
whole reason this endpoint exists and a later change making the principal an admin
would silently remove the reason.

The second decision is ``CREDENTIALS_PATH`` staying cold. It names a file the payload
reads on every database *host* and hands to a driver as a URI, so an overridable one
would turn "configure this app" into "read a chosen file across the estate". A test
asserts it is refused, because the difference between "not hot" and "not yet hot" is
invisible in the field list.
